/**
 * (Intersection) action.
 * <p/>
 * Assumptions about actions (checked in method Lane.addAction()):
 * <ol>
 * <li> Action can only be assigned to an intersection
 * <li> The end of source link is the beginning of target link
 * <li> Every priority lane must belong to some inbound link
 * (relative to source.getEnd()) other than source
 * <li>Limits of actions for one link<ul><li> there can be at most one action for the whole link (all its lanes)
 * with specified target link
 * <li> if two actions from different links have the same target link,
 * then one of them must be in 'prior to' relation to the other's source lane.
 * </ul></ol>
 * It is not an element subclass (and thus cannot be extended in modules), because
 * we do not believe there is any application for extending an action.
